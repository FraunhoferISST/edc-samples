# Policy samples

The samples in this scope revolve around the topic of policies and policy evaluation/enforcement.

> Before starting with these samples, be sure to check out the [basic samples](../basic/README.md)!

## Samples

### [Policy sample 01](./policy-01-policy-enforcement/README.md): Policy enforcement

This sample will teach you the very basics of policy enforcement. It shows the necessary configurations to enable
policy evaluation for certain rules as well as an example on how to enforce a policy with a constraint.

### [Policy sample 02](./policy-02-provision/README.md): Policy enforcement during provisioning

This sample builds on the basics learned in the first policy sample and shows how policy enforcement can be utilized
to modify resources created during the provisioning phase of a transfer. This is shown on the example of an S3 bucket
being provisioned in a specific AWS region to fulfil a location constraint in a policy.
